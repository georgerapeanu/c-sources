all files should be in the appropriately named folder
We intend to give this task with graders, so unfortunately we do not have sources without graders(but it shouldnt be that hard to change them).
tests for subtask i are named subtask_i...

Subtasks are

1. N <= 20, k<= 10, sumN <= 50
2. N <= 100, v[i] <= 40, k <= 200, sumN <= 500
3. N <= 1000, sumN <= 10000
4. V[0]=v[N-1]=1e9
5. N <=10^5
6. No further restrictions
and by default, N <= 10^6, sumN <= 10^6, K <= 10^18, v[i] <= 10^9
