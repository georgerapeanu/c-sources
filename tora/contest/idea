level1:
100 ways of splitting budget between speed and strength -> solve TSP for 100 graphs
level2:
100^3 ways of splitting budget
the rest of the problem is not a plain tsp
it is a tsp on top of a "drilling game"
it can make sense to visit a planet multiple times if the cargo allows it
practically it is not realy tsp anymore
the games will have states of the following nature

{
  current_time
  current_profit
  map<int, int> mined // mined also gives visited
}
time limit is 10k, coord limit is 10k
nearest neighbor could be a great idea
or nearest k
maybe randomly improve a path

level3
the same as level2, but with wormholes(wihch only change the mindists between planets
some placeable wormholes as well(sucks)

oxygen has no inherit cost, you can just take as much as you can
cargo capacity hold oxygen too(sucks)


I need
1. A budget placement strategy
2. A route selection strategy
3. A route improvement strategy

What is a route?
level1: an arangmenet of planets
level2: an array of (planets, mineTime)
level3: an array of(planets, mineTime, OxygenRefuel)

Possible route alterations: drop an element, insert an element, slightly alter an element
Possible budge alteration: randomly choose one, randomly increment/decrement some stuff slightly

Having these, everything else is straight forward

1. Has 2 possible solutions:
  - checking every possible solution
  - genetic shit for improving parameter, with parent crossover
2.
  - nearest neighbor(most straight forward)
  - randomly
3.
  - genetic mutation
  - genetic crossover
  
All these make me go towards a genetic algorithm aproach


we need the following states:
Actually what if i make 3 variants for each possible level combination
with that I only need initialize(), mutate(), crossover(), clone() on each of them
I can even implement different strategies
I also need on the actual solution the following methods
mutate()
crossover()
evaluate()
initialize()

clone mutate initialize and crossover should be a factory's job
evaluate should be a level job
maybe a fix would be great in order to fix broken paths we just take their prefix -> or it should be mutates job to trim an invalid path

I would also need some kind of factory which should contain settings for each
level3 route also has wormholes
